# Digital Identity

Digital identity is the essential means by which individuals, organizations, and things can prove themselves and engage in trusted interactions within digital environments.
It goes beyond simple identification, encompassing security, privacy protection, and interoperability as part of a comprehensive trust framework.

## Architecture and Reference Framework

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) defines the structural guidelines and reference model for designing and implementing a digital identity ecosystem.
It does not prescribe specific technologies, rather, it provides an abstract and generalized framework that enables diverse implementations to remain interoperable.

This document is not bound to the legal or regulatory frameworks of any specific country or region. Instead, it is based on general and globally reusable principles.

Its purpose is to provide adopters of digital identity systems with a common reference point for deciding what level of assurance to adopt and which technical approaches to use.

## Contents of the repository

This repository contains:

- "[Architecture and Reference Framework](arf.md)" the main document that describes the architecture of the digital identity ecosystem.
- "Appendix" the list of documents that provide additional information about the architecture. In particular, it provides normative high-level requirements.
- "[Discussions](discussions.md)" the list of discussion topics that are currently being discussed.
- "[Technical Specifications](techspec.md)" the list of technical specifications.
- "[LSP](lsp.md)" the description of large scale pilot (LSP) project.
- "[Reference System](refsystem.md)" the list of reference system implementation as a open source project.
