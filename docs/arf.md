# Architecture and Reference Framework

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

In digital environments, secure and trustworthy identity is a fundamental enabler for accessing services, conducting transactions, and exchanging data among individuals, organizations, and devices.
As a result, governments, international bodies, and industry stakeholders have been developing a variety of digital identity standards and technologies. Examples include Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and electronic identity (eID) frameworks, all designed to address this growing need.

However, these standards and implementations are often built on different technical foundations and regulatory assumptions, which leads to fragmentation and silos when applied globally. To ensure that digital identity ecosystems can scale and operate effectively across borders, there is a strong need for a common reference architecture and set of requirements that guarantee interoperability beyond jurisdictions and technologies.

### 1.2 Purpose of the document

The purpose of this document is to provide a reference architecture and framework for digital identity ecosystems.
It is intended to:

- Define common principles, roles, and high-level requirements for digital identity systems.
- Serve as a technology-neutral and jurisdiction-agnostic reference, applicable across different contexts worldwide.
- Support governments, organizations, and service providers in designing, adopting, and implementing digital identity solutions in a secure, privacy-preserving, and interoperable way.

Rather than prescribing detailed technical implementations or legal rules, the document aims to act as a guidance and reference point for stakeholders who are planning or developing digital identity infrastructures.

### 1.3 Scope

#### In Scope

- Definition of conceptual architecture and high-level requirements for digital identity ecosystems
- Description of roles and functions such as Identity Holder, Identity Provider (IdP), and Relying Party (RP)
- References to technical components such as DIDs, VCs, PKI, and their applicability
- Governance framework, including trust models, policies, and compliance requirements
- Representative use cases demonstrating the application of digital identity systems
- Principles and guidelines to support interoperability, security, and privacy protection

#### Out of Scope

- Detailed technical implementations of specific technologies
- Jurisdiction-specific legal and regulatory compliance details
- Designs tied to vendor-specific solutions or platforms
- Operational procedures and management guidelines for deployment
