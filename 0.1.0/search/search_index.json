Introduction","text":""},{"location":"arf/#11-background","title":"1.1 Background","text":"<p>In digital environments, secure and trustworthy identity is a fundamental enabler for accessing services, conducting transactions, and exchanging data among individuals, organizations, and devices. As a result, governments, international bodies, and industry stakeholders have been developing a variety of digital identity standards and technologies. Examples include Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and electronic identity (eID) frameworks, all designed to address this growing need.</p> <p>However, these standards and implementations are often built on different technical foundations and regulatory assumptions, which leads to fragmentation and silos when applied globally. To ensure that digital identity ecosystems can scale and operate effectively across borders, there is a strong need for a common reference architecture and set of requirements that guarantee interoperability beyond jurisdictions and technologies.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#12-purpose-of-the-document","title":"1.2 Purpose of the document","text":"<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a reference architecture and framework for digital identity ecosystems.
