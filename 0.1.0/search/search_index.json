Introduction","text":""},{"location":"arf/#11-background","title":"1.1 Background","text":"<p>In digital environments, secure and trustworthy identity is a fundamental enabler for accessing services, conducting transactions, and exchanging data among individuals, organizations, and devices. As a result, governments, international bodies, and industry stakeholders have been developing a variety of digital identity standards and technologies. Examples include Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and electronic identity (eID) frameworks, all designed to address this growing need.</p> <p>However, these standards and implementations are often built on different technical foundations and regulatory assumptions, which leads to fragmentation and silos when applied globally. To ensure that digital identity ecosystems can scale and operate effectively across borders, there is a strong need for a common reference architecture and set of requirements that guarantee interoperability beyond jurisdictions and technologies.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#12-purpose-of-the-document","title":"1.2 Purpose of the document","text":"<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a reference architecture and framework for digital identity ecosystems.

Wallets serve as secure, user-controlled environments that allow individuals and organizations to manage and present identification data and credentials across both public and private services.</p> <p>The functionalities outlined here are centered on principles of security, privacy, and user empowerment. They illustrate how wallets can support real-world interactions such as accessing government services, proving qualifications, or conducting payments while ensuring trust, interoperability, and protection of personal data.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#21-identification-and-authentication","title":"2.1 Identification and Authentication","text":"<p>Digital wallets enable individuals to authenticate themselves across a wide range of services, from community platforms to government portals and financial institutions. Authentication can combine possession of the device with additional factors such as biometrics or PINs, giving flexibility across different assurance levels. Users also benefit from transparency through access to their authentication and transaction history.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#22-attribute-presentation-with-selective-disclosure","title":"2.2 Attribute Presentation with Selective Disclosure","text":"<p>Wallets allow users to share only the specific information required by a relying party. For example, when proving age, a user can disclose \u201cover 18\u201d without revealing their full date of birth. This selective disclosure enhances privacy, while cryptographic mechanisms ensure that activity cannot be correlated across different services.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#23-digital-signature","title":"2.3 Digital Signature","text":"<p>Wallets provide the ability to create digital signatures for agreements, transactions, or approvals. These signatures can be bound to specific contexts such as a contract amount, counterparty, or date ensuring integrity, legal validity, and trust in digital interactions.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#24-pseudonyms","title":"2.4 Pseudonyms","text":"<p>Wallets can generate service specific pseudonyms that allow users to engage with different platforms without being tracked across them. This supports privacy preserving authentication while still enabling strong security, for example through integration with passkeys or WebAuthn.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#25-organizational-wallet","title":"2.5 Organizational Wallet","text":"<p>In addition to personal use, wallets can represent organizations and allow delegation of rights. An employee may act on behalf of their company, or a public official may sign a document in the name of their agency. Such delegations are verifiable, providing clarity and accountability in organizational processes.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#26-payment","title":"2.6 Payment","text":"<p>Wallets can integrate identity with payment capabilities, enabling streamlined experiences where verification and payment occur in one flow. Examples include online shopping, where a user verifies their age, completes payment, and confirms delivery details all within the wallet, or paying public fees through digital currency or open banking connections.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#27-travel-and-mobility","title":"2.7 Travel and Mobility","text":"<p>Wallets can hold credentials related to travel and mobility, such as electronic passports, visas, or driving licenses. Travelers may use their wallet for identity verification at airport checkpoints or to confirm driving eligibility when renting a car. This reduces reliance on physical documents and creates more seamless travel experiences.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#28-health-credentials","title":"2.8 Health Credentials","text":"<p>Wallets can securely store and present health-related credentials, such as vaccination records, insurance entitlements, or medical summaries. These can be used for international travel, accessing healthcare services, or simplifying insurance verification. Users gain efficiency while maintaining control over sensitive health information.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#29-education-and-professional-qualifications","title":"2.9 Education and Professional Qualifications","text":"<p>Wallets can carry digital representations of diplomas, transcripts, and professional licenses. Graduates can quickly prove their degrees to employers, and professionals can demonstrate their qualifications abroad. This reduces fraud, streamlines hiring, and builds trust in educational and professional achievements.</p>"},{"location":"arf/#3-wallet-ecosystem","title":"3.
